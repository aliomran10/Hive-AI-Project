**Rules Summary**

Players take turns placing or moving their pieces:

Introduce a new piece at any time, provided it touches at least one other piece.

Place your Queen Bee by the fourth turn.

After placing your Queen Bee, decide whether to move an existing piece or place a new one each turn.

Adhere to the unique movement rules for each piece (to be implemented as game prompts or documented later).

Surround your opponent's Queen Bee to win.

**Special Rules:**

Pieces cannot be moved if doing so splits the hive into disconnected parts.

All pieces must touch at least one other piece.
